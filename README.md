RogerWilco is a newsfeed and an internal chat. The intent of the news feed is to aggregate multiple data streams to engage and coordinate a mobile workforce. 

The newsfeed is supplied by several data sources: our internal logistics software, instagram, and a twitter-like chat with image upload.

The server updates the client via a websocket for a realtime chat in sigle page application..

There is a local authentication and external oAuth via Google.
